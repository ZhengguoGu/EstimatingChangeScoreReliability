The zip file contains 3 R files and a cpp file. 

To run the simulation.R (which simulates data and produces estimated change score reliabilities), please do the following:

Step 1. Run the 'Functions.R' (which contains a few functions used for simulation.R)
Step 2. Run simulation.R

To run the simulation_popRel.R (which simulates the population reliability), please do the following:
Step 1. Run the 'Functions.R' (which contains a few functions used for simulation.R)
Step 2. Load "populationRel.cpp' 
Step 3. Run simulation_popRel.R
